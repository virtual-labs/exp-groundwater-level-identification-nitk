        "d": "The lower resistivity values are around 6 Ω m to 150 Ω m (indicated bythe color of  dark blue to light blue) which are located mostly on theupper central part and also in the left side  of the section. They areinterpreted as potential groundwater resources in unconfined aquifers in the area."
